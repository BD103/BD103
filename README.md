Hi!

My name is BD103, and I program all sorts of things.

# Rust

Rust is by far my favorite language. I enjoy low-level programming and hope to one day maintain an active Rust project. You can find me [blogging about Rust](https://bd103.github.io) or participating in the Rust [forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/bd103/).

Fun Fact: You can view the private members of the Rust standard library by going to [stdrs.dev](https://stdrs.dev/).

# Kotlin

I'm the lead programmer for the the [BotsBurgh](https://github.com/BotsBurgh/) robotics team, which competes in [FTC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc) every year. You can check out [this year's code](https://github.com/BotsBurgh/BOTSBURGH-FTC-2023-24), if you're interested.

Fun Fact: Kotlin has around [86 unique keywords](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/keyword-reference.html).

# Vue

When I occasionally write websites, I default to [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). I frequently use [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) and [EdgeDB](https://www.edgedb.com/) too. One of my proudest projects is a [database and website](https://github.com/Phoenix-Wing/Reservoir) that tracks information for a D&D-like roleplay club I help run.

Fun Fact: One of the oldest websites I've made that still exists today is a tiny [notepad app, ~~hosted on Replit~~](https://bd103.github.io/Notepad). It was created 3 years ago. I no longer use Replit, but I still use the notepad!

**Edit:** Replit no longer hosts static websites for free. I have re-uploaded the website to Github [here](https://github.com/BD103/Notepad).
