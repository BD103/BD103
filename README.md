Hi there, I'm BD103! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an open-source contributor with a strong interest in game development, tooling, and infrastructure.

# Bevy

I've been an active contributor and community member of [Bevy], a game engine written in [Rust], since November 2023. Here's some Bevy-specific projects I've been involved in:

- [The Bevy Engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)
- [Bevy's Website](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website)
- [The Bevy Linter and CLI](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli)
- [flag-frenzy](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/flag-frenzy)
- [bevy-bencher](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy-bencher)

> [!TIP]

> I gave a talk on the Bevy Linter at the 7th Bevy Meetup! You can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao2gXd_CgUc), with the code examples [here](https://github.com/BD103/Bevy-Meetup-7).

I also spend a lot of time building continuous integration for projects. Some tools that I maintain include:
